A light weight addon which allows you to display up to three resource bars reflecting your characters health, primary resource and an additonal resource of your choice.

These bars can be customized with options including, but not limited to: size, position, color, and color gradients.

In addition, there's extra options to add percentage values next to your unit frame and on top of the target frame.

Note: The inspiration to make this addon was the discontinuation of WeakAuras (and certain older addons that are not updated for WoW 12.0 or above). I'm OCD with my layouts, hence the naming of this addon. I figured if I liked this style of resource bars, maybe someone else does too. If you're one of those people, enjoy! - KurenBatsu
